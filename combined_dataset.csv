They (used to) carry my favorite flavor, their consitency is amazing, no other icecream has matched their...how do I word this... cold-itude? Some flavors are too scary for me to try, but, unless you don't like icecream, I'm nearly sure Blue Bell has something for everyone. Worth the extra buck."

I wish my family in PA had Blue Bell as an option."

,"Like myself,  Bluebell is a native Texan! I love the variety of flavors and have grown up eating Bluebell. Honestly, I can't think of ever eating another brand! My favorite birthday memories from growing up is the excitement of getting my own little tiny 'carton' of bluebell ice cream. It was so much fun. A friend recently move to Pennsylvania and laments that I can't ship her Bluebell ice cream!"
,"Blue Bell is the best ice cream in the world.  I will go without if it's not Blue Bell.  I love it so much I would work there and want to visit the creamery.

,Bluebell has been available in my supermarket for over a year now and my entire family loves it.The flavors are fabulous and the monthly headliners are super.  I buy at least a new flavor every month.
,I have never had a Bluebell  flavor I didn't like.  I just wish they would carry some of their seasonal flavors all year round like the chocolate cherry.  Simply the best!  Their vanilla is awesome if you are a vanilla fan. I usually wait for a sale as this ice cream brand is a bit pricey.
,"When I splurge on my diet, Blue Bell is the brand of ice cream to go to. I love the peach cobbler and blueberries crumble when it's in season. I also love the fact that they have pint size. Because I don't feel as guilty eating the whole thing. lol"

,Can we say blue bell over and over  how i love this ice cream
,We love this ice cream and wait (not so) patiently for new and seasonal flavors. The go to in our home is the basic homemade vanilla and red velvet cake. No other brand can match the flavors.
,Blue bell by far is the best ice cream. My family can't get enough of their pistachio almond. I can't buy it too often because it's there one minute...gone the next. I'm luck if I get bowl.
,This is the only brand of ice cream our family buys.  We love pairing the Homemade Vanilla with Apple crisp.  It really does taste the closest to homemade.

,Great ice cream with so many flavors to choose from!
,"Out of the all of the ice creams I have had throughout my 32 years, Blue Bell, in my opinion, is the one that tastes closest to homemade ice cream out of the hand cranked churn that I had as a child on hot summer days. This brand really takes me back to my childhood."
,I took a field trip to Blue Bell as child. I really love the rich taste. You get what you pay for!!
,"God bless these people for staying with real ice cream box sizes!!!!!  Honestly, that act alone makes this company reveal their authenticity and truthful advertising position.  The product is wonderful. It has all the YUM you expect in REAL ice cream."
,"Even with their recent recall, I will remain a loyal customer of Blue Bell! One recall after over 100 years? Not bad, Blue Bell, not bad at all. My favorite... Vanilla Bean. Classic."

,Blue bell is one of my all time favorite ice creams. My favorite flavor is cookies and cream.
,This ice cream is amazing. Prefer it over most brands. So many different flavors to choose from
,"The only reason why I like blue bell is because they are the only ice makers that make my favorite ice cream flavor banana pudding. Now if you from the south you what banana pudding is and how it should taste. So you can imagine I was skeptical about trying it. But it was better than the real dessert! It is thicker and creamer and I prefer it over the actual dessert. I think it is seasonal flavor because I do not see it all the time. But when I do I grab it! I am not this crazy about any other flavor they have, but that one banana pudding flavor top all the others."
,I have always loved blue bell because the homemade vanilla taste like I remember my parents making that took hours.. this was a great flavor and I will definitely get it again

,It did get a recall but the ice cream is still great and the best
,I love this ice cream I can't wait until they get it back in stores this is a historic brand and I can't wait until the future generation get to try it
,"This is my favorite ice cream brand, however it's hard to find! I can only find it at one local grocer and it's kind of out of my way and a bit spends but it's definitely worth it! DELICIOUS."
,Blue Bell ice cream is very good. I have tried this flavor and if you like a coffee flavor you will love this!
